  `
    Namaskaram dear parents, would-be brides, and grooms, I am Smt. Kalyani. This is my son's matrimonial profile. I want to share with you a few thoughts that have been close to my heart since I was young. I believe that marriage is a sacred ceremony that increases the joy manifold. The bride, in particular, should be given the utmost care and importance because she leaves her family to join a new one. She is, after all, referred to as <em>'Kanya Ratnam'</em> (her counterpart <em>'Vara Ratnam'</em>).
  `,
  `
    When marriage is such a beautiful and romantic journey, why should girls and boys compromise or make haste? Shouldn't we take time to ensure compatibility in all aspects of life? For example, in my son's case, he would first prefer a bride who has <em>Daiva Bhakti</em>, <em>Guru Bhakti</em>, and dedication to family, as he himself embodies these qualities.
    <p>Shouldn't these qualities be the top priorities for anyone?</p>
  `,
  `
    For my son, a girl interested in learning subjects such as Computers, English Literature, Cosmology, Sanskrit, Music (vocal or instrumental), Kuchipudi, or Bharatanatyam would be greatly preferred. My son has a keen interest and some knowledge in these areas, and he would love to appreciate, enjoy, share and grow in these fields with his life partner.
  `,
  `
    Don't you agree with me when I say that the bride and groom should find each other physically attractive and have meaningful conversations before stepping into <em>Grihastashrama</em>?
    <p>Are not compatibility and mutual understanding the foundations of a happy and lasting marriage?</p>
  `,
  `
    If you agree with my thoughts, kindly contact me if you have such a girl in your family or if you would like to share your views. I look forward to hearing from you.
