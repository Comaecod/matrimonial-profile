  `
    Namaskaram dear parents, would-be brides, and grooms, I am Smt. Kalyani. This is my son's matrimonial profile. I want to share with you a few thoughts that have been close to my heart since I was young. I believe that marriage is a sacred ceremony that increases the joy manifold. The bride, in particular, should be given the utmost care and importance because she leaves her family to join a new one. She is, after all, referred to as <em>'Kanya Ratnam'</em> (her counterpart <em>'Vara Ratnam'</em>).
  `,
  `
    Donâ€™t you agree that before entering <em>Grihasthashrama</em>, the bride and groom should find each other physically attractive and be able to engage in meaningful, heartfelt conversations? When the family is such a sacred and noble institution, should not the <em>Grihalakshmi</em>â€”the <em>Samragni</em> of the homeâ€”be lovingly present at home to care of her in-laws, husband, and children, shaping the household into a strong and beautiful home! Has it not been said that the family is the first school, and the mother, the first teacher? After all, is not compatibility and mutual understanding the very foundation of a happy and an enduring marriage?
  `,
  `
    When marriage is such a beautiful and a romantic journey, why should girls and boys compromise or make haste? Shouldn't we take time to ensure compatibility in all aspects of life? For example, in my son's case, he would first prefer a bride who has <em>Daiva Bhakti</em>, <em>Guru Bhakti</em>, and dedication to family.
    <p>Shouldn't these qualities be the top priorities for anyone?</p>
  `,
  `
    For my son, a girl interested in learning subjects such as Computers, English Literature, Cosmology, Music (vocal or instrumental) would be greatly preferred. My son has a keen interest and some knowledge in these areas, and he would love to appreciate, enjoy, share and grow in these fields with his life partner.
  `,
  `
    Should my thoughts align with yours, I invite you to kindly get in touch. If, however, you find any discrepancies or errors in my understanding, I sincerely welcome your guidance. I remain open to learning from anyone rooted in the wisdom of our <em>Guru Parampara</em> and the sacred scriptures.
