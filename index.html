    <main>
      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          Namaskaram dear parents, would-be brides, and grooms, I am Smt.
          Kalyani. This is my son's matrimonial profile. I want to share with
          you a few thoughts that have been close to my heart since I was young.
          I believe that marriage is a sacred ceremony that increases the joy
          manifold. The bride, in particular, should be given the utmost care
          and importance because she leaves her family to join a new one. She
          is, after all, referred to as <em>'Kanya Ratnam'</em> (her counterpart
          <em>'Vara Ratnam'</em>).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="qualities">
        <p>
          When marriage is such a beautiful and romantic journey, why should
          girls and boys compromise or make haste? Shouldn't we take time to
          ensure compatibility in all aspects of life? For example, in my son's
          case, he would first prefer a bride who has <em>Daiva Bhakti</em>,
          <em>Guru Bhakti</em>, and dedication to family, as he himself embodies
          these qualities.
        </p>
        <p>Shouldn't these qualities be the top priorities for anyone?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="interests">
        <p>
          For my son, a girl interested in learning subjects such as Computers,
          English Literature, Cosmology, Sanskrit, Music (vocal or
          instrumental), Kuchipudi, or Bharatanatyam would be greatly preferred.
          My son has a keen interest and some knowledge in these areas, and he
          would love to appreciate, enjoy, share and grow in these fields with
          his life partner.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="thoughts">
        <p>
          Don't you agree with me when I say that the bride and groom should
          find each other physically attractive and have meaningful
          conversations before stepping into <em>Grihastashrama</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Are not compatibility and mutual understanding the foundations of a
          happy and lasting marriage?
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="contact">
        <p>
          If you agree with my thoughts, kindly contact me if you have such a
          girl in your family or if you would like to share your views. I look
          forward to hearing from you.
